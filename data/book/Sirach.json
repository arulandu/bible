Now, those who read the scriptures must not only themselves understand them, but must also as lovers of learning be able through the spoken and written word to help the outsiders. So my grandfather Jesus, who had devoted himself especially to the reading of the Law and the Prophets and the other books of our ancestors, and had acquired considerable proficiency in them, was himself also led to write something pertaining to instruction and wisdom, so that by becoming familiar also with his book[^b] those who love learning might make even greater progress in living according to the law.\nYou are invited therefore to read it with goodwill and attention, and to be indulgent in cases where, despite our diligent labor in translating, we may seem to have rendered some phrases imperfectly. For what was originally expressed in Hebrew does not have exactly the same sense when translated into another language. Not only this book, but even the Law itself, the Prophecies, and the rest of the books differ not a little when read in the original.\nWhen I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes and stayed for some time, I found opportunity for no little instruction.[^c] It seemed highly necessary that I should myself devote some diligence and labor to the translation of this book. During that time I have applied my skill day and night to complete and publish the book for those living abroad who wished to gain learning and are disposed to live according to the law.||In Praise of Wisdom||All wisdom is from the Lord,  \n    and with him it remains forever."},{"verse": 2, "text": "The sand of the sea, the drops of rain,  \n    and the days of eternity--who can count them?"},{"verse": 3, "footnotes": {"a": "Sirach 1:3 Other ancient authorities read _the depth of the abyss_"}, "text": "The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth,  \n    the abyss, and wisdom[^a]--who can search them out?"},{"verse": 4, "footnotes": {"a": "Sirach 1:4 Other ancient authorities add as verse 5, _The source of wisdom is God\u2019s word in the highest heaven, and her ways are the eternal commandments._"}, "text": "Wisdom was created before all other things,  \n    and prudent understanding from eternity.[^a]"}]}
